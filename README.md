## Citadel Datathon
<br>* a datathon competition at CMU
<br>* more than 500 applicants in the first round
<br>only 100 was selected into the final round
<br>Finally, we got 5th Place.
## Brief summary
<br>The dataset is consist of 60 million samples about gene data. We tried to find the most predictive predictor to predict whether a person was healthy or got cancer. Thus, after clearning and preprocessing data, we built a gaussian naive bayes model. By calculating log-likelihood raito and symmetric KL-divergence, we find that breast is the most predictive one which should be focus on during diagnosis.
