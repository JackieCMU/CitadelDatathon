## Citadel Datathon
* a datathon competition at CMU
* more than 500 applicants in the first round
* only 100 was selected into the final round
* Finally, we got 5th Place.
## Brief summary
* size of dataset: 60 million 
* target: find the most predictive predictor to predict whether a person was healthy or got cancer. 
* method: Gaussian naive bayes model(simple). By calculating log-likelihood raito and symmetric KL-divergence, we find that breast is the most predictive one which should be focus on during diagnosis.
